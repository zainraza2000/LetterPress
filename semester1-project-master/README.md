LETTERPRESS- A game developed on C language incorporating basic programming concepts of if-statements, loops, function calling and returns, and ever dreadful pointers.

The game implemented is relatively simple where letters fall from the top of console all the way to the baseline before which they have to be typed to score
otherwise a life is lost against every letter.
